# üê± Catus Locatus

A fun little project that the idea of came as a curiosity as to why a similar app was not implemented. (I don't really know if it was)

Catus Locatus is a lost pet finding app. Announce a pet you lost by showing others where it was lost. Other people can contact you if they find your pet! All pets are drawn on top of a Leaflet map, with dog/cat emojis for easier searching. The website only accepts coordinates of your current location, to reduce the number of false reports.
